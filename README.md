# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project

## Introduction
In this project we are supposed to prepare a tidy dataset from a given untidy dataset. The given dataset is based on an experiment that had been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 HZ is captured and recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, Training Dataset and Test Dataset. 

 To complete the task following steps has been followed - <ol><li> Downloading and Unzipping Data Folder</li><li> Reading datasets and Merging them </li> <li>Tidying and Summarising for the final result
</ol>

## Objective
As per the project description, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Review Critera:
<ul> <li> The submitted data set is tidy. </li> <li> The Github repo contains the required scripts.</li> <li> GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. </li> <li> The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable. </li> <li> The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it. </li>

## Containing Files

+ **run_analysis.R:** The final analysis script that downloads the dataset, processes and tidies it for analysis and then creats a tidy summary dataset for the final result that meets the following requirement:
    <ol>
    <li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
    <li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
    <li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li> 
    <li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
    </ol>
+ **Submitted Dataset.txt:** The text file where the summarized tidy dataset is saved. 
+ **Week 4 Peer graded assignment.Rproj:** RStudio project file where the the run_analysis.R script is created.
+ **getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip:** This is a saved copy of the downloaded, zipped dataset.
+ **CodeBook.md:** Description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
